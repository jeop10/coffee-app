# coffee-app
A simple POC of a coffee-shop

## Setup process

First you need to clone this repo. After that you will need to run the `setup.sh`
script this will pull the other 2 needed repos for this project to work, [Fronted](https://github.com/jeop10/coffee-frontend) and [Backend](https://github.com/jeop10/coffee-frontend).

After that, assuming that you have installed docker on your server you should run
`docker-compose up`

Which will load up the project and have everything ready for you to see the app on port 80.
